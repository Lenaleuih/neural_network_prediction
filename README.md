# Neural Networks

The application of neural networks to learning problems has been ongoing for 20 years, often to predict student behvior or to parse unstructured data such as student writing samples and provide natural sounding feedback through AI avatars.

## use cases and application

* explain the utility of artificial neural networks
* explain the backpropagation algorithm
* build a basic neural network to solve a prediction problem

## how does it work

The project builds a neural network to predict student attentional state from webcam imags.
